CSR layers system is being used.
C - Controller layer	deals with the client
S - Service layer		deals with the business logic
R - Repository layer	connects with the DB.

*Implementation layer - Part of the service layer. Implements the service interfaces.
*Repository layer consists of Entity package
	1. It contains class that can be mapped to to Tables in the DB.
	2. Therefore the entity objects will be mapped.

Factory design patter is used in the service layer.
	1. Interfaces are created for features.
	2. Implementation classes are for actual logic.
	3. This is done so that in future multiple implementation classes can be created for
		same interface.
